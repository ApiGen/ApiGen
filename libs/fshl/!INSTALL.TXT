About FSHL
--------------------------------

    FSHL is a free, open source universal syntax highlighter written
    in PHP. Very fast FSHL parser performs syntax highlighting for few
    languages (HTML with embeded PHP and CSS, PHP, CSS, JAVA, CPP, PYTHON)
    and produces XHTML output.

    FSHL library is just only syntax highlighter. Its API provides only
    few methods, which are really need to highlight sources.
    FSHL does not support any form of results caching. I think that
    this is job for your CMS, which can do this better than FSHL.

	FSHL core is very flexible *1) and when you want add any new
	languages, send any suggestions to me.


Installation and usage notes
--------------------------------

    Basic installation is very easy:

    1. copy entire sub-directory 'fshl' into your project

        WARNING: Copying full FSHL distribution with code examples
                 is STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED, because some scripts,
                 such as 'update_fshl_cache.php', requires write
                 access to internal directories ('fshl/fshl_cache').
                 Write access is required in DEVELOPPING AND TESTING
				 CYCLE ONLY, when a new lexers are builded or
                 tested by the FSHL developers.


    2. Choose the best output module for your project, or make your own

       There are some deafult output modules in 'fshl/out' directory:

         HTML         - is default output module and produces XHTML output.
                        Results must be manually embeded to <pre> tag.

         HTML_HP      - like HTML module, but adds links to help pages on
                        defined keywords.

         HTML_UTF8    - like HTML, but uses UTF8 multilingual coding scheme

         HTML_HP_UTF8 - like HTML_HP but multilingual with UTF8 coding


       NOTE: I recommend you to use UTF8 output, but when you need parse
			 strings in differend code page, this may be changed in
			 output module. FSHL working with raw text data at input,
			 and results are converted through htmlEntities() inside the
			 output module.


    3. Create your best adapter between FSHL and your project

       FSHL is only highlighter, simple and fast :)
       If you want superb API try another one.


    4. Create your own nice CSS stylesheet, or use existing one.

       You must link CSS manually in your HTML templates, FSHL never
       builds any stylesheets.


    5. Check updates at http://hvge.sk/scripts/fshl


Code examples
--------------------------------

	examples/simple.php - there are some basic usage examples
    examples/stream.php - example shows how to highlight very large files on the fly

    Look at 'index.php' file located in the root of distribution.
    This demo code is also good way to understand how to FSHL works.


Stylesheet example
--------------------------------

    Nice default stylesheet is located in the 'fshl/styles/COHEN_style.css' file.
	NOTE: You may copy this file into better location in your project.

	Thank you for using FSHL,
	the fastest *2) highlighter

Footnotes
--------------------------------

	*1)	FSHL is flexible, but there is serious problem to handle postfix notations.
		This capability will be added in future releases.

	*2) FSHL is really fast. Sometime about ten time faster than other highlighters
		written in pure PHP.
