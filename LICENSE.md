# Licenses #

You may use ApiGen under the terms of either the New BSD License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or 3.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the framework. If the GPL fits better to your project, you can use the framework under this license.

You don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You can freely use ApiGen in commercial projects as long as the copyright header remains intact.
